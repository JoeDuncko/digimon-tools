    <h1>Digimon Card Game Quick Start Guide</h1>

    <h2>The Four Types of Cards</h2>

    <h3>Digimon Cards</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You pay memory costs to play or evolve these cards.</li>
        <li>They can also make attacks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Digi-Egg Cards</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Digi-Egg decks can contain up to five cards.</li>
        <li>Digi-Egg cards can be hatched or digivolved from the breeding area.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tamer Cards</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Once played, Tamers stay on the field and their effects remain active.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Option Cards</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            To play an Option card, you must have a Digimon or Tamer on the field of the same color.
            The breeding area counts.
        </li>
        <li>Option cards are sent to the trash after use, unless stated otherwise.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Deck Construction</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You need a 50-card deck made of Digimon cards, Tamer cards, and Option cards.</li>
        <li>A Digi-Egg deck with up to 5 cards.</li>
        <li>Decks can contain no more than 4 copies of a card with the same card number.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Setting Up</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Shuffle your Digi-Egg deck and place it in the breeding area.</li>
        <li>Shuffle your main deck and place it in the deck zone.</li>
        <li>Both players roll a die — the player with the highest roll goes first.</li>
        <li>
            Each player draws 5 cards. You may mulligan once by shuffling your hand into your deck
            and drawing 5 new cards.
        </li>
        <li>Place the top 5 cards of your deck into your security stack.</li>
        <li>Place the memory counter on 0.</li>
        <li>The first player skips their draw phase.</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Memory Gauge:</strong> Track and pay memory costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Stack:</strong> Stack of 5 cards at the start of the game.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Battle Area:</strong> Area where you play Digimon and Tamers to do battle.
        </li>

        <li>Pay the play cost, then play the Digimon from your hand to your battle area.</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Attacking</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Turn the Digimon sideways (suspend).</li>

            </ul>

    </ul>

    <h4>Battles</h4>

        <li>The one with the lower DP is deleted.</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Security Checks</h4>
