    </table>

    <h3>Deck Construction</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You need a 50-card deck made of Digimon cards, Tamer cards, and Option cards.</li>
        <li>A Digi-Egg deck with up to 5 cards.</li>
        <li>Decks can contain no more than 4 copies of a card with the same card number.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Setting Up</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Shuffle your Digi-Egg deck and place it in the breeding area.</li>
        <li>Shuffle your main deck and place it in the deck zone.</li>
        <li>Both players roll a die — the player with the highest roll goes first.</li>
        <li>
            Each player draws 5 cards. You may mulligan once by shuffling your hand into your deck
            and drawing 5 new cards.
        </li>
        <li>Place the top 5 cards of your deck into your security stack.</li>
        <li>Place the memory counter on 0.</li>
        <li>The first player skips their draw phase.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>The Field</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Memory Gauge:</strong> Track and pay memory costs.</li>

        <li><strong>Digi-Egg Deck:</strong> Up to 5 Digi-Eggs.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Breeding Area:</strong> Safe zone. Digimon here can't attack or be affected. Effects
            don’t trigger here, but you still draw when digivolving.
        </li>
    </ul>
